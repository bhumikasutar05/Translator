# Translator WEBSITE with Text-To-Speech
A simple Translator web application built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, allowing users to translate text between multiple languages and hear the translated result. The app features:

Real-time Text Translation: Users can input text and receive instant translations.
Text-to-Speech Support: After translation, users can listen to the translated text in the target language.
Language Selection: Choose from a variety of source and target languages.

This project demonstrates the use of web technologies to create an interactive, user-friendly translation tool with speech functionality.
